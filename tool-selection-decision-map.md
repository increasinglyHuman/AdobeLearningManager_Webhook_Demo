## The Question Map

| If you're asking... | You need... | Because... |
|---------------------|-------------|------------|
| "What's the current status of X?" | **Appy API** 📚 | APIs answer questions on demand |
| "Tell me WHEN something happens" | **Webby Webhook** 💡 | Webhooks push notifications instantly |
| "How do I make this work FAST with my specific system?" | **Natty Native-Extension** ⚛️ | Native extensions speak your system's language |
| "How do I share data with System Y?" | **Conner Connector** ♾️ | Connectors translate between systems |
| "How do I get permission to use these?" | **Appleberry Application** 🍱 | Applications manage your access keys |

## Real-World Scenario Map

### Scenario 1: "I want to track student progress"
```
Need real-time alerts when student completes module?
├─ YES → Webby Webhook (instant notification)
└─ NO → Appy API (check when needed)
```

### Scenario 2: "I need to sync with our HR system"
```
Does ALM have a pre-built integration?
├─ YES → Conner Connector (use existing)
└─ NO → Do you have dev resources?
    ├─ YES → Natty Native-Extension (build custom)
    └─ NO → Appy API + external middleware
```

### Scenario 3: "I want a dashboard showing completion rates"
```
How often does data need updating?
├─ Real-time → Webby Webhook (push updates)
├─ Every hour → Appy API (scheduled polling)
└─ On-demand → Appy API (user-triggered refresh)
```

## The "Don't Do This" Anti-Pattern Map

| ❌ Don't use... | When you need... | ✅ Instead use... |
|-----------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Appy API (polling every second) | Instant notifications | Webby Webhook |
| Webby Webhook | Historical data lookup | Appy API |
| Natty Native-Extension | Simple data sync | Conner Connector |
| Conner Connector | Complex custom logic | Natty Native-Extension |
| Any of them | Without proper keys | Appleberry first! |

## The Efficiency Matrix

| Use Case | Response Time | Resource Usage | Best Tool |
|----------|---------------|----------------|-----------|
| "What's the count now?" | Immediate | Low (on-demand) | Appy API |
| "Alert me when done" | Instant | Very Low | Webby Webhook |
| "Custom oven controls" | Microseconds | Optimized | Natty Native |
| "Share with CRM" | Seconds | Moderate | Conner Connector |

## The Combination Patterns

### Pattern 1: "Initial Load + Live Updates"
```
1. Appleberry → Get API keys
2. Appy → Load current state
3. Webby → Subscribe to changes
```

### Pattern 2: "Multi-System Sync"
```
1. Appleberry → Get credentials for all systems
2. Conner → Set up standard integrations
3. Natty → Build custom parts where needed
4. Webby → Alert on sync issues
```

### Pattern 3: "Custom Dashboard"
```
1. Appleberry → Provision access
2. Appy → Pull historical data
3. Webby → Stream live updates
4. Natty → Optimize performance-critical parts
```

## The One-Question Quick Guide

Ask yourself: **"Do I go TO the data, or does the data come TO me?"**

- **I go to data** → Appy API (library visit)
- **Data comes to me** → Webby Webhook (doorbell delivery)
- **I need it my way** → Natty Native-Extension (custom built)
- **I need translation** → Conner Connector (interpreter)
- **I need access** → Appleberry Application (key master)

## Developer Cheat Sheet

```javascript
// Appy API - Request/Response
GET /api/courses/progress?userId=123
// Use when: Checking current state

// Webby Webhook - Event Push
{event: "COURSE_COMPLETED", userId: 123}
// Use when: Reacting to changes

// Natty Native-Extension - Platform Code
import ALMNative from '@alm/native-sdk';
// Use when: Maximum performance needed

// Conner Connector - Pre-built Integration
configure({ source: 'ALM', target: 'Salesforce' })
// Use when: Standard integration exists

// Appleberry Application - Key Management
createApiKey({ scopes: ['read', 'write'] })
